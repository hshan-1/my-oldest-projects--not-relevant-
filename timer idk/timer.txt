one of my ambitious(at the time) projects 

my main goal was to make timer (really ambitious)
that saves changes of time? i don't know 
using windows batch file shuts down pc with value in ms saved in that script 

it saves but you can't use that saved time when you start app again
i was supposed to do that but abandoned this project
